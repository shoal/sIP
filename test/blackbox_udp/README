Test: /test/blackbox_udp/
 - Desktop PC userspace driver
 - Intended to test UDP listening, checksums and ARP
 - Logs all transfers to a pcap file
 - Responds to specific packet types with manually crafted packets (assumed correct)
 - Stack application layer just echo's sent string

To Build:
 - CD to this directory
 # gcc -g -c *.c
 # cp *.o ../../src/
 - Link the *.o files
 - Note that main.c/o contains the 'int main', so you dont need your own.

To Use:
 - Run ./a.out
 - Results file (capture.pcap) can be viewed in Wireshark

Expected Results:
 - ARP request TO stack
 - ARP request FROM stack
 - UDP data FROM stack
 - UDP data TO stack
 - (last 2 repeated 50 times)

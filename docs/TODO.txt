 TIMER
  - Make timer more configurable (different clocks)
  
 GENERAL
 - Deal with packet fragmentation (for now assume fixed length packets)
 - If PHY/MAC receives a frame that is too large for our max frame, what to do??
 - Remove standard datatypes (int, char) and use uint8_t etc.
 - Optimise ETH_MAXDATA, UDP_MAXDATA, IP_MAXDATA etc in stack_defines.h
 - Convert my crazy buffers to something a bit more manageable.  Zero-Copy??
 - Sort out the init_* functions [if(!init)init]
 - Locate and remove 'magic-numbers' from code

 PROTOCOLS
 - Implement checksum validation for incomming UDP and IP
 - Review implementation of Ethernet, ARP, IP and UDP protocols
 - Add ICMP, DHCP and TCP protocols
 - Ethernet CRC generation and checking (is there a need?)

 OPEN SOURCE
 - Recruit & perform code review focusing on readability (focus on consistency and removing clever code)
 - Debate zero-copy from simplicity perspective

 TESTING
 - Locate some hardware for testing & porting
 - Investigate integrating with Linux or VM for enhanced testing

 DOCUMENTATION
 - Generate documentation for compilation options such enabling IP checksum validation
 - Get some easy instructions together for porting
 - Instructions to include into an AVRStudio/PIC project.
 - FAQ & Doxygen @ shoalresearch.com

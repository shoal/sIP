<b>Sometimes 'locks up' for a little bit.</b>
Some functions have been made to block, such as waiting for ARP 
replies.  If this is being implemented on a 
multitasking OS, then task queues for things like ARP and DHCP 
would be useful.

<b>Why centiseconds?</b>
Millisecond resolution seems like overkill to me, as it is only 
used for timeouts in this appliction.  Generally a timer interrupt 
is used, ms interrupts might spend more time interrupting than 
doing anything useful.

<b>Why aren't all features of the RFCs implemented correctly, if at all?</b>
sIP is designed to be a very simple TCP/IP stack to help learn how the 
protocol works, as well as being simple to port to other Media Access 
Controllers, microcontrollers and processors.  Many advanced features 
didn't seem worth including.  That said, sIP was designed to be easily 
configurable, so if certain functionality is required, either let me 
know, or have a go at implementing it yourself (please send in your 
patch afterwards!)

<b>What about IPv6</b>
At present this is not implemented as I didn't see much use for it on 
a system initialy intended for 8-bit microcontrollers.  I'd be happy 
to add it if there is enough demand.  Donating some IPv6 networking 
hardware for me to use for testing would certainly motivate me ;-)

<b>What about other networking protocols</b>
I have no intention of actively adding other protocols other than IPv4
and possibly IPv6 in the future.  The code is easy to understand and easy 
to add other protocols, so if you understand the protocol then adding it 
shouldn't be too hard.  If there is enough interest in a particular 
protocol then I will see about adding it, otherwise if you do it 
yourself, please submit your patch to the project.

<b>The security is weak</b>
Yes, this is currently very true.  As mentioned elsewhere, this is a 
very simple stack designed to show how TCP/IP works and provide simple
and portable code.  It is not intended to be used on a public facing server
(although it could very easily be adapted to be), besides, it was intended 
for 8-bit microcontrollers with 10MHz clocks, don't expect DDoS prevention
any time soon ;-)  Please help me document any weakneses found even if we
cant fix them it will be educational.

<b>Security flaws</b>
Problems specific to sIP;
ARP does not check if it originaly sent a request that it has a response for.
ARP cannot deal with IP conflicts.
ARP does not check the packet is from who it says it is from.

<b>Coding Standards</b>
Ideally the code should conform to some form of standard in order to help
ensure it is maintainable and easy to read.  The code did not originally 
conform to any such standard.  From now on, code will be (re)written to conform
to the MISRA C coding standards.  Note that this code does not current comply
with the standard.

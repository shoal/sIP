Simple IP (sIP) is an TCP/IP stack designed for embedded
devices, allowing small microcontrollers to communicate via
Ethernet.  

The stack has been kept as simple as possible to ensure
that it meets the strict size constraints of the target 
hardware (including 8-bit micros) and also allows students
to study an entire stack without any additional
complications.

The stack is not complete and is available online purely
for backup purposes at the moment.  Completion is expected 
during 2011 (as it is a spare-time project).

Modifications are welcome, and code critique/review even
more so.

Regards

Dave
